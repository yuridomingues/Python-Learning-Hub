# organizing the code with variables

# You can only use letters, numbers and underscore to define variable names
x = 4

# my name = "Yuri" # will gen an error

my_name = "Yuri"
print(my_name)

# if the variable is uppercased, use uppercased, if the variable is lowercase, use lowercase
# if the variable is uppercased and you use lowercase to reference, will get an error

# the variable can't start with numbers

a4 = 4 # is right
# 4a = 4 # will get an error

# exist some reserved words, like if, while, etc..
# if you try to make a variable with reserved words, will get an error

# python don't save in memory anything after the runned script, so if you want to save a data in a memory, you need to save in a archive, database, excel archive, etc..
