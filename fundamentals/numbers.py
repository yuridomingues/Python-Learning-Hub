print (1 + 2) #3, int number

# how to check if the variable type?

print(type(5.0)) # <class 'int'>
# we can use the type method to check variable type

# but this isn't a error in python, we can use this:

print(5.0 + 5) # 10.0

print(2 * 4 + 6) # 14

# to use priority patterns we can use parenthesis, like in math

print(2 *(4 + 6)) # 20

# but he is limited in math patterns like division per 0, will show a error
# decimal numbers is always "." not ","
